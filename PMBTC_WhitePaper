PMBitcoin or Polygon Mineable Bitcoin

Tokenized bitcoin PoW mineable on the Polygon/MATIC network utiziling a Proof-of-Burn and more! Uses these two contracts together

Polygon Mineable Bitcoin is a ERC20 token for the Polygon/Matic blockchain. 


Symbol      : PBMTC
Decimals    : 9
Name         : Polygon Mineable Bitcoin - PMBTC
Total supply: 32,100,000.00
   =
 21,000,000 Mined over ~100+ years using Bitcoins Distrubtion halvings every 4 years 
                   Using the Proof-of-Work Contract PMBTC2
   +
 11,100,000 Auctioned over 100 years in 4 day auctions split fairly among all buyers, ALL Auction proceeds go back into Miners pockets via the contract
                   Using the Proof-of-Burn Contract MinersGuild2

 No premine, dev cut, or advantage taken at launch. Public miner and public pool available at launch.

The contracts used in the design for PMBTC are:
  A) 0xBitcoin - aka Proof-of-Work Contract -
        A way to securly distributed tokens using Proof-of-Work. 21,000,000 tokens are distributed by Proof-of-Work
        Machines connected to the contract solve a complicated hash unique to their ethereum address in order to 
        Set to be average 10 minute solves overall, it will reward 50 PMBTC per solve or a total of 28,800 PMBTC every 4 days 
               The reward will half every every ~4-5 years 
        recieve a mining reward of up to 5 different cryptocurrencies and PMBTC!

  B) Vether - aka Proof-of-Burn Contract
        A way to securly auction off PMBTC every 4 days.  11,100,000 tokens are distributed by Proof-of-Burn.
        Our contract collects MATIC payments for 4 days.  After 4 days it divides the reward by how much MATIC you sent vs the total and you recieve your percentage of the PMBTC in your wallet.
                     The total PMBTC per auction to start is 24,330 
                           The amount per auction will halve every 204 auctions(~800 days).

  C) Shuffle - Added to Proof-of-Work Contract - A way to keep track of the top 512 addresses and reward them with part of a transaction.
        Our contract rewards the 100% of the top 512 holders with 10% of PMBTC &
        Our contract rewards 50% of the Matic of every mint to one of  400 of the 512 Spots - This will allow fighting for these coveted spot
        Our contract rewards an extra 50% of the Matic of every mint to the miner if they are one of  100 of the 512 Spots - This will allow fighting for these coveted spots
        Our contract rewards the top 512 addresses with 1/2% of all transactions
        Our contract rewards the Proof-of-Burn or MinersGuild2 contract with 1/2% of every transaction

Then I added to these contracts
    A way to distribute up to 5 different cryptocurrencies at once!  Send in any ERC20 compatible token and it will turn itself into a Proof-of-Work token that will distribute FOREVER in our contract(But mostly over 2 years).
          The contract can distribute any Cryptocurrency that is ERC20 compatible!
   A way to maintain the costs without inflating the price! These ERC20 compatible tokens can be passively mined with virtually no extra costs.
   The miner simply decides what 5 cryptocurrencies he wants to mine, and the contract does the rest.
   Give-away wrapped NFTs and valuable items or 1/1s with proof-of-work at 12 hour intervals.
   A way to stop the instant spamming new contracts and make them fight with HASHPOWER for your NFT or Tokens.

Then I added some extra abilities that all proceeds go 100% back to the miners!
    For 500 Matic reduce the difficulty in half! Allows the miners for a cost to reduce difficulty and increase profits.
    For 100 Matic CLEAR the Top 512 holders list(not balance just their spot Top 512), forcing inactive holders to make a transaction and fight for their heap spots again.


The reason why PMBTC is born: after the DeFi massive widespread on the Ethereum mainnet, gas fees for transactions have become too high. This has a relevant and heavy impact on all the projects, and particularly if considering mined-tokens: submitting solutions and claiming rewards have become too expensive.
The alternative is offered by the Polygon/MATIC Chain: with its low gas fees, fastness and smart-contract execution capabilities, it is the most suitable environment to give rebirth to bitcoin through the tokenized minable asset PMBTC.
