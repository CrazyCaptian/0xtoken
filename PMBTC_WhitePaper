This will serve as the whitepaper for Polgon Mineable Bitcoin or PMBTC or PM for real short and my design process behind the token!
This contract deployment was two contracts large because of the large size.

The inital design was to bring a part of every system that I enjoyed in crypto and see if I could deploy something a little new.
I initalled upgraded all the code to the contracts of to 0.7.6
  A) 0xBitcoin - A way to print tokens using Proof-of-Work.  Connected machines solve a complicated hash unique to their ethereum address in order to recieve a mining reward

  B) Vether - A way to 24,330 PMBTC every 4 days.  Every 204 auctions the auction amount halves(~800 days). This allows for fair entry without being a miner!
        https://etherscan.io/address/0x4Ba6dDd7b89ed838FEd25d208D4f644106E34279#code
  C) Shuffle - A way to keep track of the top 512 addresses, which we reward with 10% of the mining reward and 1/2% of all transactions. A 8% discount on purchasing PMBTC at auction if you are the current winnerz on the Shuffle send (variable: winnerz)
