This will serve as the whitepaper for Polgon Mineable Bitcoin or PMBTC or PM for real short and my design process behind the token!
This contract deployment was two contracts large because of the large size.

The inital design was to bring a part of every system that I enjoyed in crypto and see if I could deploy something a little new.
  A) 0xBitcoin - A way to print tokens using Proof-of-Work.  Connected machines solve a complicated hash unique to their ethereum address in order to recieve a          mining reward
        https://etherscan.io/address/0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31#code
  B) Vether - A way to 24,330 PMBTC every 4 days.  Every 204 auctions the auction amount halves(~800 days). This allows for fair entry without being a miner!
        https://etherscan.io/address/0x4Ba6dDd7b89ed838FEd25d208D4f644106E34279#code
  C) Shuffle - A way to keep track of the top 512 addresses, which we reward with 10% of the mining reward and 1/2% of all transactions. A 8% discount on purchasing      PMBTC at auction if you are the current winnerz on the Shuffle send (variable: winnerz)

Then I added my own twist ontop of these contracts
    A way to print up to 5 different cryptocurrencies at once!  Send in any ERC20 compatible token and it will turn itself into a Proof-of-Work token that will distribute FOREVER in our minter(But mostly over 2 years).
          A way to maintain the costs without inflating the price! These ERC20 compatible tokens can be passively mined with virtually no extra costs!
          We can give-away wrapped (NFTs) and valuable items or 1/1s!
    A way to reduce the difficulty in half! Why not allow the miners for a cost to reduce difficulty and increase profits!
    A way to CLEAR the Top 512 holders, forcing inactive holders to make a transaction and fight for new heap spots!!!!
    A way to maintain the costs without inflating the price! These tokens can be passively 
    

I initalled upgraded all the code to the contracts of to 0.7.6 solidity standards
